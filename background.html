Early life and family
Main article: Allu–Konidela family
Ram Charan was born in Madras (now Chennai) to Telugu film actor Chiranjeevi and his wife Surekha on 27 March 1985.[2] He has two sisters: Sushmitha and Sreeja.[4] He is the grandson of Allu Ramalingaiah and the nephew of Nagendra Babu, Pawan Kalyan, and Allu Aravind. He is the cousin of Allu Arjun, Varun Tej, Sai Dharam Tej, Allu Sirish, Niharika Konidela, and Panja Vaisshnav Tej.

Ram Charan was educated at Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan, Chennai,[5] Lawrence School, Lovedale,[6] The Hyderabad Public School, Begumpet,[7] and then at the St. Mary's College, Hyderabad.[8] He also attended Kishore Namit Kapoor's acting school in Mumbai, Maharashtra.[9][10]

Acting career
2007–2009: Debut and breakthrough
In 2007, Charan made his film debut as the leading actor in Chirutha, which was directed by Puri Jagannadh and completed 50 days in 178 direct movie theaters and 15 other shifted movie theaters.[11] He played the role of Charan, an ex-convict seeking to kill his father's murderer. Rediff.com praised his performance, stating: "Ram Charan is quite promising. Dance and action appear to be forte. He is rather graceful in the dance numbers. He also stays clear of any oblique reference to his star father by way of dialogue or adopting any particular mannerism or style."[12] His performance in the film earned him a Filmfare Best South Debutant Award and Nandi Special Jury Award.[13]

After the release of the 2009 film Magadheera, his second film, Charan established himself as one of the leading contemporary actors in Tollywood. The film, in which he played dual roles, was directed by S. S. Rajamouli, and Charan's performance was critically acclaimed. The Times of India stated that "Ram Charan returns as a valiant soldier and breathes life into the larger-than-life role with ease. He showcases his horse-riding and dancing skills to perfection."[14] IndiaGlitz commented: "Charan has come up with a mature performance and he has carried the film very well. Both his characters were done justice, and he reminded of his father at many places."[15] Magadheera grossed over ₹150 crores worldwide and held the record of being the highest-grossing Telugu film until 2013 before it was surpassed by Attarintiki Daredi.[16] The film received six Filmfare Awards including two awards – Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and Nandi Special Jury Award for Charan.[17]

2010–2013: Career fluctuations
Charan starred in Bommarillu Bhaskar's urban romantic film Orange in 2010 as Ram, a NRI living in Australia.[18] Although the film didn't perform well at the box office, critics praised the storyline and performance by Charan.[19] Jeevi of Idlebrain felt that Charan didn't tried to stick to stardom and is not willing to repeat the mistakes performed by stars.[20] Over the years, it became a cult film and received appreciation from the audience.[21] In her article for Film Companion, Alekhya Devarakonda compared his character to Howard Roark of 1943 novel The Fountainhead.[22] Following a year-long absence from the screen, he next appeared in Racha (2012), directed by Sampath Nandi. He played the role of "Betting Raj", a gambler. The film completed a 100-day run in 38 centres across Andhra Pradesh on 13 July 2012.[23] Racha's final share for its distributors was ₹45 crore (US$5.6 million).[24] His performance in the film brought two nominations, including Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and SIIMA Award for Best Actor (Telugu).[25][26] Sify stated, "Both, actor Ram Charan and his director Sampath Nandi play a safe game by following the same pattern of earlier mass-masala movies."[27] Radhika Rajamani of Rediff criticized the plot of the film, but praised Charan's performance in action sequences and dance moves.[28] IndiaGlitz wrote: "He shows flashes of Chiru-ness more than he ever did in the past; be it his baritone or demeanor, he is a Megastar in effect. Helped by a strong script, he could have been much better."[29] The film was released on 5 April 2012 and was declared a commercial success.[30]
